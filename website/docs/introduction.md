### What is Coffeescript ?

Coffeescript is a programming language that transcompiles to Javascript. Its
syntax, which is heavily influence by Ruby and Python programming language, is
designed to improve readability and brevity of Javascript.

Hmm...What is Javascript anyway? To understand what is Javascript, we first
need to know brief history of web.

### HTML, CSS and Javascript (The three musketeers of Web)

Lets use a house construction as an analogy. We can think of HTML as the
*structure* and foundation of the buildings. The engineer designs where to
place the wall, door, windows, etc. This is the same concept when we open
www.wikipedia.com. The site's *structure and content* are defined by grouping
headings, paragraphs, blocks, images and constructed by a web developer.

When the house structure is finished, the interior designer will choose the
color of the wall, windows, curtain styles. Over the years the wall will be
repainted, the furnitures will be replaced and maybe the house does not need
curtain anymore. But, the structure of the house still the same (bar fire and
natural disasters). We can think of these as CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) to a
web page, where its *contents* stays the same even though the size of the
headings, the font types and colors or even the positioning of the paragraph.

And finally, after our beautiful new house is finished, we need utilities
connected to get the TV and hot shower going. Nowadays, we probably will
install programmable thermostat, lights (LIFX anyone?) and the rest of
furnitures to live comfortably. We can think of these as Javascript, the *glue*
that binds everything. In web, Javascript is used to create the rich and
interactive web (Think of Gmail interface, Calendar application,
drag and drop effect, fancy animation effects).

### Why Coffeescript ?

Why learn and use Coffeescript then ? Why don't just write plain Javascript? 

One of the reasons is **Productivity**. Many programmers enjoy writing and reading
Coffeescript (Refer to pg. for syntax comparison). Other reason is Framer
studio, the Mac application which we will be using throughout this guide only
allow us to use Coffeescript.

Not everyone like Coffeescript. There are plenty of healthy debates on the
internet about the pros and cons of coffeescript. There is also ES6, the next
version of Javascript which the Javascript creator claimed is heavily influcence
by Coffeescript.

For now, let's learn Coffeescript.
