a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic
name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity or
information referred to as a value. (Wikipedia).

Think of variable as a bucket which can be filled with any values (number, string)

```
coffee> a = 2
coffee> b = 2

coffee> a 
coffee> 2

coffee> b
coffee> 2

coffee> c = a + b
coffee> ?
```
