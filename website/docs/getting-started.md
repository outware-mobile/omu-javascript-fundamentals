### Getting started
Welcome! This brief guide is intended to get you started prototyping
mobile/web applications using FramerJS.  No prior Coffeescript or FramerJS
knowledge are required.

Before we get started, below are all the tools that are used throughout this. It
is highly recommended to have them installed prior starting.

#### Text Editor
Text editors of your choice. Atom is very popular nowadays :)

- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom] (https://atom.io/)

#### Framer studio

- [Framer Studio](http://framerjs.com/)

#### Coffeescript 

The easiest way to install coffeescript is via npm. If you do not have npm
installed on your machine, you can install it via [Hombrew](http://brew.sh)

```
brew install node
npm install -g coffee-script
```
