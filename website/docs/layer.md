A layer is just an *object* with properties. (..... Memory referesh). If we go
back to Object (page xxxx), Likewise a babushka doll that has color and size
properties, a layer has width, height, x and y coordinates, opacity and other
properties.

We can think of Framer layer as *Photoshop / Sketch* layer. PS layer consists of
properties such as width, height, etc. It can also be nested (layers inside
layers). The difference is while these settings are configurable via GUI in PS /
Sketch, we use code to set the settings in Framer / Framer studio.

*TODO: Talk more on How layer is usually created in Sketch*
