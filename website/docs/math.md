There are different type of data in Coffeescript. Let's start with *Number*.  

Number in Coffeescript  can be positive, negative or decimal. 1, 200, 10.0, -2
are all valid numbers.  

Nearly all Math basic operations are supported in Coffeescript. Addition,
substraction, division, multiplication and even more complicated operations
such as sin, cos, sqrt , log, etc. 

Lets practice. Open your Framer studio or alternatively type *coffee* on your
terminal. This will open a Coffeescript console.

#### Framer Studio

```
puts 1 + 1

puts -1 + 1

puts 1.2 + 1.8
```

#### Terminal

```
coffee> 1 + 1

coffee> -1 + 1

coffee> 1.2 + 1.8
```

Everyone got it ?
